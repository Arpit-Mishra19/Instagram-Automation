# Instagram Scraping with Selenium
## Overview
This project provides a script to automate the process of logging into Instagram, handling pop-ups, and searching for users using Selenium. The script is designed to help with basic interactions on Instagram for scraping or other automation tasks.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

1. Python: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Chrome Browser: Google Chrome should be installed.
3. ChromeDriver: Automatically handled by the webdriver_manager package.
4. Required Python Packages: Install the required packages using pip.
## Installation
1. Clone the Repository: If you have the repository, clone it. Otherwise, you can create a new file for the script.
2. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip:
   pip install selenium webdriver-manager

## Notes
1.Update Credentials: Replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your Instagram login credentials.
2. Search Query: Update 'target_username' with the username or hashtag you want to search for.
3. Handle Pop-ups: The script assumes that a pop-up will appear and provides basic handling. Adjust the XPath or handling as needed based on actual pop-ups.
4. Error Handling: Basic error handling is included. Review and adjust based on your specific needs.

## Troubleshooting
1. Timeout Issues: Increase wait times if elements are not loading fast enough.
2. Element Locators: If Instagram updates its page structure, element locators (XPath) may need adjustments.
